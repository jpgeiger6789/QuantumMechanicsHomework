a)
To find A, we set ∫ p(x) from x=-∞ to x =∞ equal to 1
∫ p(x) = 1 = ∫ A * e^(-λ[x-a]^2) * dx | x=-∞ to x =∞

The closest integral I could find was the cumulative distribution function      https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html
Note that the website uses the variable μ where our homework uses the variable a.  I will use the variable a instead. 

D(x) = 1/[σ*sqrt(2*pi)] * ∫ e^[-(x'-a)^2/(2σ^2)] dx' | from x'=-∞ to x'=x
D(x) = (1/2)*{1 + erf[(x - a)/(σ * sqrt(2)]}

The reason I like this is that it has suitable boundaries of integration - its boundaries are x'=-∞ to x'=x, so if
you evaluate it at x=∞, it is equivalent to integrating the original function from x=-∞ to x=∞
Also, our original function can be transformed to an equivalent form using simple substitutions.    
As far as I can tell the erf function does not work here because the limits of integration are from x to 0, and it's
not obvious how to interpret our integral in terms of the erf function (although we could transform our system into
a form suitable for use with the erf function)

We can transform our Gaussian probability to an appropriate form by using the following definitions:

λ = 1/(2σ^2)
σ = sqrt(1/[2*λ])
sqrt(pi/λ) = [σ*sqrt(2*pi)]
sqrt(pi/λ) * sqrt(λ/pi) = 1

We're going to redefine the term preceding the integral in terms of λ rather than σ

D(x) = 1/[σ*sqrt(2*pi)] * ∫ e^[-(x'-a)^2/(2σ^2)] dx' | from x'=-∞ to x'=x                           <<original equation

b)
By graphing this function online with random values for A, λ, and a, I can get a preliminary understanding of how
this function behaves.  This is a bell-curve, with a symmetric gradient, offset from the origin along the x-axis,
and with a certain height
A is the magnitude of the maximum value of the curve at its peak.
    Since we are treating this as a probability distribution A will always be normalized per part a)
a is the offset from the origin along the x axis to the center of the bell curve
λ is the width of the base.  at x=a+/-λ/2, the probability density drops sharply

    Note - we did know this would be the answer when we originally messed around with the variables.  However, it's
    good to learn how to work with gaussian integrals, and I hope to god to never have to do this again

    We haven't given this a full-depth exploration, but suffice it to say that Mark just plugs this into a
    calculus-calculator and lets the computer do the integration.  When you do this, you will get the following
    output (Mark did pull the λ out of the exponential but I'm just going to give the answer):
<x^2> =  ∫ x^2 * p(x) = ∫ A * x^2 * e^(-λ[x-a]^2) * dx | x=-∞ to x =∞     
<x^2> = [sqrt(pi)/2] * sqrt(λ/pi) * 1/λ^1.5 = 1/(2λ)

        So my plan here is to integrate dT using the definition of the cumulative distribution function from earlier
        I'm trying to evaluate this as an indefinite integral but D(x) is a definite integral, and I don't think
        that what I'm trying to do is valid
        I've copied the definitions of D(x) from earlier for reference
 
    D(x) = sqrt(λ/pi) * ∫ e^[-(x'-a)^2/(2σ^2)] dx' | from x'=-∞ to x'=x                                     <<this our simplified version of D(x)
    D(x) = (1/2)*{1 + erf[(x - a)/(σ * sqrt(2)]}                                                            <<this is the solution to the integral

        It feels like I should be able to substitute x=∞ here and use the fact that D(x) was already integrated from
        -∞ to x
        However, when you integrate by parts using a definite integral, you evaluate the product of T*R at x=-∞ and 
        then at x=∞.
        T(∞) * R(∞) - T(-∞) * R(-∞) = Q                                                                     <<I'm just using Q as a temporary output variable here
        The problem is that I don't know what R(∞) or R(-∞) are.  I only know D(x) and D(∞)
        D(∞) = T(∞) - T(-∞)
        D(x) = T(x) - T(-∞)
